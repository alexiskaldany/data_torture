## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library("corrplot")
library("ezids")
library("gtsummary")
library('ggridges')
library('viridis')
library('wesanderson')
library('gridExtra')
library('leaps')
library('vtable')
library('pscl')  
```

```{r}
data = read.csv('datafile.csv',encoding = "UTF-8")
```
